## Tech stack
I used this as an opportunity to check out [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
<br>It was fun to use even when migrating from Astro 1.0 to 2.0.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |

| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                              |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`        |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`            |

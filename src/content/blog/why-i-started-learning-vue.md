# Intro

Learn React if you want to get a job quickly. That’s the advice I hear a lot in YouTube videos, podcasts, newsletters, reddit, Twitter and just about anywhere tech is discussed. There’s a lot of React jobs, you can get your foot in the door quickly and get a high salary! Well, I’ve given up right now. I’ve coded a lot the past 4 years of my journey and still haven’t gotten my first job. I’ve made coding a hobby because I genuinely like it and I’m extremely bummed it hasn’t worked out. The silver lining is that I’m using this opportunity to try out Vue. Back in 2020 Honeypot Dev released this Vue documentary which was phenomenal. Evan and all the devs enthralled me with their passion. I’m gonna learn Vue after I get my React job! Three years pass and with no job, nothing is holding me back now. React has also changed a lot (not like Vue hasn’t changed either!) but it’s so quick that if I don’t follow tech Twitter I would have gotten completely lost. It’s one of the reasons I decided to learn Vue.

## React has so many tools. What do I do with them?

Just this past year React has added React Server Components, updated the React docs, deprecated Create React App in favor of NextJS and many more. I’m not a 10x developer, I’m not even a developer professionally, I don’t know why I need SSR. The React docs now recommend you to start your project with NextJS or Remix. I started using NextJS back in 2022 and loved the DX of it. However, in my wack personal projects of a massive 0 users, I don’t think I’ve been able to push Next to its full potential. This seems different from the Vue approach.

Theo had Evan on a podcast to talk about Vue and Vite (love them both obviously).(Note at 38:30) Theo asked Evan “when we’ll see Nuxt as a top level recommendation in the docs similar to what React did.” Evan does mention Nuxt is recommended but he know that a lot of the audience of the Vue docs is newer to web development. “Throwing them into server-side rendering can be a bit daunting for them,” Evan starts off with “Think of Vue as a Client side only thing is first, once you understand that, if you actually want to use this thing use Nuxt.” As a new developer still looking to get some footing in the industry, I really appreciate the approach Evan took thinking about his users. I feel like personally for me React changed so quickly that I wonder if I even know it all. My app broke moving to Next app directory. You can’t use hooks so my context and data fetching didn’t work. Data fetching with just fetch looks a lot better than getStaticProps but there seems to be a lot of magic. React is sick, but Vue is also sick. Maybe I can be a better developer learning both. It’s been fun so far!

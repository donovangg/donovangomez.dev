  Fighting game resource hub with resources submitted by the community.

<h2 class="text-3xl my-4">Project Inspiration</h2>

<p class="text-xl my-4">
  Fighting games are hard. Tutorials in game kinda suck and a lot of teaching is
  left to the community. The community has plenty of good resources for many
  different games but some are hard to find. After looking for awhile on a
  r/streetfighter I realized, maybe other people are looking for this. It would
  be cool if there was a single site for some cool stuff to check out.{" "}

  I really enjoyed using file based routing with Next, styling with Tailwind and
  Supabase to get up and running for my backend. Next Auth takes care of the
  Google Auth and the Form that users submit goes to Formspree.

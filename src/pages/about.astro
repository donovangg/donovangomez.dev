          Hi I'm Donovan!

        <p class="text-lg">
          I have extensive background in customer service with over 10 years
          across different industries. My real passion that took awhile to find
          was building small web apps that people could use. I was inspired by
          the old Halo 3 companion by Bungie back in 2007. Learning by building
          is how I work best which is why I have spent a lot of time learning
          the fundamentals of the web and the React ecosystem.

        <p class="text-lg">
          While I'm still looking for a full time role I've done my best to get
          some experience (and money) for some of the code I write. I had a
          worked on a contract basis with the owner of <a
            href="https://simplish.co/"
            class="link link-secondary"
            target="_blank">Simplish</a
          >, who I met while teaching kids how to code at <a
            href="https://www.thecoderschool.com/"
            target="_blank"
            class="link link-secondary">theCoderSchool</a
          >. While prototyping a web app for Simplish I got to work with React,
          Tailwind and the Twilio API. At theCoderSchool I do my best a teach
          programming basics in a fun way using Scratch, JavaScript or game
          engines like Unity.
